## Goal
Contribute primitives the Midnight ecosystem can reuse via open-source packages and specs.

## Candidate Contributions (SDK-Adjacent)
1. **DUST sponsorship client SDK**
   - A standard client for sponsored transaction flows.
2. **Encrypted Private State Backup (EPSB)**
   - Versioned, encrypted export/import format for private state.
3. **Lightweight sync middleware**
   - Reduce mobile sync cost; privacy-preserving queries.
4. **Proof orchestration layer**
   - Queueing, retrying, cancellation, progress, telemetry (without leaking secrets).

## Near-Term Focus
Ship the embedded SDK foundation first, then extract reusable submodules.
